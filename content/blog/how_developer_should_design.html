<p>
    For a long time, the design represented a difficult challenge for the developer, and because the developer always tries to think in a way that they fill in logic, the design sometimes contradicts this aspect and needs more on the creative side But before we continue on how to find a solution to this issue, let us know why design is important
</p>

<h1>Why Design important ?</h1>
<p>
    The design is of great importance for several reasons 
    <ol>
        <li>Users see and care about the design,
                they donâ€™t see the complex code:
                <p>First thing the user will judge when he opens your app is the design , the better the design the more likly the user will love your app so it's mor important than the code</p>
            </li>
        <li>The user experience is crafted by design:
            <p>it's clear that every idea and new feature in the company has to run by the designer who will do research and build the design in a way that will make the user experience better</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    after we know the importance of the design let's go through the current process of designing and try to improve it :)
</p>


<h1>How Developer Do Things currently ?</h1>
<p>
first he will get the design files from the designer ,"who uses tools like sketch and zeplin",
 and start to mock them up using his development tools like (xcode , android studio or any text editor for the web developers)
<br>
<br>
 <img src="/img/developer_design/sign_up_page.png" alt="Example of an app screen"><br>Example of an
app screen</img>
<br>
<br>
as we can see an Example for a signup page here the develoepr will start building the componanets of the page
<br>
<br>
<img src="/img/developer_design/element_example.jpg" alt="Component Example"><br>Simple Component Example</img>
<br>
<br>
each component has mutible attributes like 
    <ul>
        <li>Font</li>
        <li>Text Color</li>
        <li>Border Color</li>
        <li>Background Color</li>
        <li>Placeholder Color and Font</li>
        <li>Multiple States (enabled, disabled, selected)</li>
    </ul>
    now the developer will start reading these attributes for each componanets from design application to code
</p>
<h2>Why is this not recommended?</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Design takes 2/3 of the time when building any project</li>
        <li>High chance of having human errors</li>
        <li>Not easy to build complex design</li>
        <li>High effort required to change and maintain the design</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br>
<h3>How much time does it take? To build a simple design?</h3>
<p>
    <img src="/img/developer_design/do_math.gif" alt="">
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="/img/developer_design/math.gif" alt="">
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="/img/developer_design/number_of_process.png" alt="">
    <br>
    <br>
    this number is releated to the developer and will change from one to one depending on the developer speed of building the things
    <br>
    but as an avarage and just for comparing purpose
    that mean for avarage it will take about
    <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">32 days</span> to build the design
</p>

<h3>How can we reduce time needed? And build better and more complex designs?</h3>
